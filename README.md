Predicting the winner of a Formula 1 race is really challenging due to the wide range of factors that affect race outcomes, including qualifying results, driver skill, and team performance. Already existing prediction systems are either not beginner friendly or depend on betting markets. This project seeks to solve this by creating a machine learning model that uses documented and recent race performance data to predict future race winners. The information that can be analyzed as a result of this project has much to offer for many individuals.

The objective is to create a machine learning based project that can accurately predict the winners of a future Formula 1 race using past and recent race data. Our strategy is to collect race information, transform it into machine readable features, and apply it to predict the Formula 1 race winners.
